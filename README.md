# RustLearn
A repo to store all my 6-Month Rust learning steps.

# Instalation of the Rust Language
(Linux - Debian)

```$ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh```

After everything is done, you should receive a message like this:

```Rust is installed now. Great!```

The installation of Rust also includes a copy of the documentation locally, so you can read it offline. Run ```rustup doc``` to open the local documentation in your browser.

# Rust Version
```$ rustc --version```
